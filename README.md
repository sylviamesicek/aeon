# Aeon

`Aeon` is a zig package for solving N-dimensional elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs using the finite difference method and block-structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR).

## To Do

To reach the state of minimum viable product (MVP) the following features must be completed.

- [x] Adaptive Quadtree based meshes.
- [x] Stencil application.
- [ ] Transfer between regridding runs.
- [x] Interior ghost node filling.
- [x] Exterior ghost node filling.
- [x] Restriction operator.
- [x] Prolongation operator.
- [x] BiCGStab(l) Solver.
- [x] Jacobi's Method.
- [x] Multigrid elliptic solver.
- [x] Runge Kutta 4th order method.
- [x] Hyperbolic solver.
- [x] VTK Output.
